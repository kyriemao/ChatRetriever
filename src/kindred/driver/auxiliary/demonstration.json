Best of all, the ingredients you need, such as brown sugar, honey and olive oil, are all easy to come by. It might interest you to know that olive oil is the simplest, purest moisturizer in the world. It can be used anywhere on your body, including the extra dry spots like your elbows, knees and feet. It is also an excellent facial moisturizer, and if you decide to use it on your face, keep in mind that very little olive oil is needed.

Simply place the shea butter and the cocoa butter in a glass bowl and microwave for about 30 seconds until melted. Stir in the arrowroot powder and baking soda, then add the oils and stir again.

Your legs get more robust with these exercises. You can cover a longer distance with each stride if you have stronger legs. Sufficient muscle strength will act as a foundation for power training, which depends on this strength and converts it into speed. Specialized weight training improves your running performance. Half Marathon Training with Weight Lifting You need at least two weight training sessions per week. Here is a list of great strength training exercises for runners. Compound workouts such as Trap Bar and Squats and single-leg workouts such as lunges are great ways to work out multiple muscle groups at the same time. The lunge matrix is a great strength training exercise that can be done with or without weights. To start, your body's weight is sufficient enough as a great starting point for the lunge matrix. Take complete rest for at least 45 seconds up to 3 minutes between sets. Strength training needs a longer rest period because it is more exhausting and demanding on your overall body.",

Remember that running is a priority and when push comes to shove you need to select runner-specific training (i.e. running) over strength training and cross-training.

Details of the Watergate Scandal were exposed in investigations prompted by the media, especially by two reporters from the Washington Post, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, along with their mysterious informant, \"Deep Throat\". The scandal surrounding the Watergate break-in and the subsequent cover-up by Nixon and his aides culminated in the president's resignation on August 9, 1974.",

                "response": "In June 1972, Nixon authorized members of his secret unit, as well as CREEP, to pay a team of burglars to infiltrate the Democratic Party's headquarters at the Watergate complex. This was before the election, and the burglars were meant to acquire information on his opponents. These undercover individuals broke into several Democratic offices within the Watergate and installed wire taps and recording equipment. Unfortunately for Nixon, the equipment was installed haphazardly and had to be readjusted. As the intruders attempted to return to Watergate and resolve the problem, they were arrested. The White House immediately attempted to downplay the break-in, but behind the scenes, Nixon and his secret team were quickly using funds to pay for the silence and cooperation of the intruders. Nixon also made sure that the FBI remained out of the incident by forcing the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to persuade the intelligence community that the break-in was classified as a matter of national security. The Nation Reacts While Nixon thought he was able to successfully cover up the break-in at the Watergate complex, members of the press, Congress and legal experts began questioning the event. By January 1973, the Watergate intruders stood trial for their participation in the break-in.",

Meanwhile, Congress intervened when the Senate organized the Watergate Committee to investigate the event. Needless to say, the walls were closing in around Nixon, and it became much worse. John Mitchell, the head of CREEP, was convicted of engaging in illegal activities by federal prosecutors. When that information became public, Judge Sirica increased the pressure on the Watergate intruders. In March, Sirica finally achieved his desired outcome when one of the intruders released information linking CREEP to the break-in. The dominoes were now falling one by one. In May, another convicted intruder testified before the Watergate Committee and revealed additional information linking not only CREEP, but the Nixon Administration to the events at Watergate. Eventually, the Watergate Committee called on John Dean, who was Nixon's lead legal counsel, who testified to Nixon's involvement in the break-in and cover-up. Simultaneously, the one piece of evidence that Congress, as well as the federal prosecution, needed was Nixon's taped conversations in the Oval Office.",

Judge Sirica and Congress both refused the compromise and instead sent a special prosecutor for the case, Archibald Cox, to present Nixon with a subpoena for the tapes. In another outlandish move, Nixon used his executive powers to terminate Cox as a prosecutor in what became known as the ' Saturday Night Massacre .' Nixon Surrenders Nixon's intransigence and outright defiance failed to pay off. While Nixon attempted to release sanitized versions of his tapes, many had had enough. On July 24, 1974, the United States Supreme Court ruled in the case of U.S. v. Nixon that Nixon's use of executive privilege was not applicable in a criminal investigation. Within weeks of the decision, the House of Representatives approved the impeachment of Nixon on the grounds of obstruction of justice, violation of the constitution and the unlawful withholding of evidence. To make matters worse, a tape was released, known as the 'smoking gun,' which unveiled Nixon agreeing to a CIA cover-up of the Watergate break-in during a phone conversation in 1972.",

Further, as a result of Watergate, the presidential office was weakened, allowing the Soviets to expand. In addition, Watergate also led to the North Vietnamese regaining territory because the president was too busy with Watergate. Not only did this scandal affect the world, but it also hit the homeland hard. The Republican party was severely damaged; the American people lost all trust in Republicans. The Democrats gained 49 seats in the House and five in the Senate. The scandal helped wipe out a generation of Republican politicians. Leading to a democratic majority, which advocated less government, lower taxes, and more libertarian views. Another element that came out of Watergate was Congress's attempt to limit the campaign funding of presidents.

ABC's Serena Marshall reported on that anniversary: \"Since its passage, girls' participation in sports has gone from 1 in 27 to 2 in 5 at the high school level.\" Bostock said this and Nixon's other positive accomplishments did enough to outweigh the failures of his administration. \"I think if you look back -- and what better time to look back on a man's life than on the 100th anniversary of his birth? -- at the totality of his record and the influence he had on the country and the world, it was really extraordinary and on balance for the good,\" he said.
