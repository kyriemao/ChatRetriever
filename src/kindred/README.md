# File Organization

To initiate a program, you need to specify the argument, the data, the model, and your task.
Thus, we organize the following parts:
- arguments
- data
- models
- driver: various task engines, including training, indexing, retrieval, evaluation, and so on.
- trainer: for training
- loss: for training
- utils: all useful functions
